  Run and extend the pytest suites for the CE installer (scripts/install.py and the
  scripts/ce_installer package). Use when a developer asks to run installer tests, check
  coverage, add a new test, or verify a change to the installer didn't break existing
  behaviour.

# CE installer test suite

Tests live in `tests/installer/` and run under pytest. Nothing here contacts a cluster:
the unit suites patch the `helm`/`kubectl` wrappers, and the golden suite puts stub
binaries on `PATH`.

These cover the installer only. The chart's own tests are the other scripts in `tests/`
(`helm-template-test.sh`, `kind-test.sh`) plus `make helm-lint` — unrelated to this suite.

## Prerequisites

None beyond `uv`. Every target resolves its own dependencies; there is no virtualenv to
create and nothing to `pip install`.

## Run everything

```bash
make installer-test
```

That is two suites, and they fail for different reasons:

| Target | What it runs | A failure means |
|---|---|---|
| `make installer-test-unit` | `tests/installer/test_*.py` except the golden one | a function computes or prints the wrong thing |
| `make installer-test-golden` | `tests/installer/test_golden_argv.py` | what the installer *does to a cluster* changed |

Run one file, or one test, the usual way:

```bash
uv run --isolated --with pytest --with hatchling --with-editable ./scripts \
  pytest tests/installer/test_validators.py -q
uv run --isolated --with pytest --with hatchling --with-editable ./scripts \
  pytest tests/installer -k "otel" -q
```

Take the dependencies from `--with-editable ./scripts` rather than listing them by hand.
A hand-written list drifts from `scripts/pyproject.toml`: the Makefile's used to, omitting
`click`, which `cli.py` imports directly — it only appeared to work because an older typer
pulled click in transitively.

## The two kinds of test, and which one you want

**Unit suites** import a module, patch its command wrappers, call one function, and assert
on the result or the calls made. Fast (the whole set is well under a second) and precise.
Most new tests belong here.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_cli.py` | commands, flag parsing, the argv pre-parse, env precedence, `--enable-otel` folding, run order, log output |
| `test_config.py` | `ce-config.yaml` parsing, required-field checks, never overriding a flag |
| `test_validators.py` | every pre-install check, and crucially which ones block versus warn |
| `test_cluster.py` | chart-source resolution, dependency handling, namespaces, `KUBE_CONTEXT` injection |
| `test_registry.py` | the pull secret, password file handling |
| `test_regressions.py` | one named test per entry in `scripts/AGENTS.md`'s "Fixed bugs" |

**The golden suite** runs the whole installer as a subprocess with stubs on `PATH` and
compares every `helm`/`kubectl`/`docker` call against a recorded file in
`tests/installer/golden/`. It catches what unit tests structurally cannot: a flag that
parses correctly but never reaches helm, a step that runs in the wrong order, an argument
dropped between layers.

These files are the specification, not a snapshot of whatever the code happened to do. A
recorded line is a promise about what the installer does to a cluster, so treat a diff in
them as a behaviour change to justify, never as noise to re-record away.

### When the golden suite fails

Read the diff before doing anything else. If the change is intended:

```bash
make installer-test-golden-update
git diff tests/installer/golden/
```

Every changed line is a change in what the installer does to somebody's cluster — that diff
is the reviewable part of your PR. Re-recording without reading it defeats the whole
mechanism.

Add a case to `CASES` in `test_golden_argv.py` whenever a flag gains behaviour that reaches
helm or kubectl. Refusals belong there too: how the installer declines is as much a contract
as how it succeeds.

## Shared fixtures

Defined in `tests/installer/conftest.py`; do not redefine them locally.

| Fixture | Use |
|---|---|
| `settings` | a `Settings` with every field pinned, so nothing depends on your shell |
| `recorder` | the `Recorder` class — records argv, replays canned `Result`s by argv substring |
| `capture_logs` | `logs = capture_logs(validators)` collects log text without rich formatting |
| `clean_env` | autouse; scrubs every installer env var before each test |

`clean_env` is not optional politeness. A developer who exported `KUBE_CONTEXT` to drive a
real cluster once made a test fail in a way that looked exactly like a code regression, and
the hunt for a nonexistent bug cost more than the test was worth.

## Adding a test

1. Pick the file matching the module you changed.
2. Name it after the **symptom a user would report**, not the function under test:
   `test_node_capacity_warns_but_never_blocks`, not `test_validate_node_capacity_2`. When it
   fails in two years, the name should say what broke.
3. Use the shared fixtures.
4. Comments explain *why* a case matters or what it caught. Never restate the code.
5. **Verify the test can fail.** Reintroduce the bug in the source, confirm red, restore:

   ```bash
   # edit scripts/ce_installer/validators.py to break the behaviour
   uv run --isolated --with pytest --with hatchling --with-editable ./scripts \
     pytest tests/installer/test_validators.py -k your_test -q   # must FAIL
   git checkout scripts/ce_installer/validators.py
   ```

   This is not ceremony. Writing this suite caught a test asserting on `prompt_or_env` that
   passed whether or not the behaviour it named was present, because the value it checked
   was falsy either way.

### Traps specific to this codebase

**Patch the module under test, not `shell`.** Every module does `from .shell import kubectl`
and holds its own reference, so patching `shell.kubectl` changes nothing:

```python
monkeypatch.setattr(validators, "kubectl", recorder)   # right
monkeypatch.setattr(shell, "kubectl", recorder)        # silently does nothing
```

**`docker_available()` is `lru_cache`d.** Call `shell.docker_available.cache_clear()` or
patch it on the module under test, or one test's answer leaks into the next.

**Errors are exceptions, not exit codes.** `die()` *returns* the exception so call sites read
`raise die(...)`. Assert with `pytest.raises(InstallerError)` and check `.code`.

**No `from __future__ import annotations`, no `str | None`.** The installer supports Python
3.9 and typer resolves annotations at runtime; postponed annotations break its option
parsing in ways the error message does not explain.

**Blocking versus warning is the thing to assert.** A validator that starts blocking when it
should warn makes the installer refuse a cluster that works fine. Assert the return value,
not just the log text.

## Linting

```bash
make installer-lint-python   # check
make installer-format        # fix in place
```

`tests/installer` sits outside `scripts/`, so the targets pass
`--config scripts/pyproject.toml` explicitly — at the repo root ruff falls back to its
defaults and disagrees about line length.
