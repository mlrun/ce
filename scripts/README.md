# MLRun CE Installer

Interactive installer for the MLRun CE Helm chart on a local or CI Kubernetes cluster.

By default it installs the **published** chart from `https://mlrun.github.io/ce`, so the
one-liner below works with no repo checked out. To install this repo's own chart instead —
the working tree, on whatever branch you have checked out — pass
`--chart-path ./charts/mlrun-ce`. See [Install this repo's chart](#install-this-repos-chart).

## Requirements

Three tools, and `uv` supplies the Python:

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| `uv` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` — brings its own Python interpreter and resolves the installer's dependencies itself, so there is nothing to `pip install` and no virtualenv to manage |
| `helm` | [install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) |
| `kubectl` | Configured and pointing at your cluster |

`docker` is **not** required. The image pull secret is a Kubernetes Secret the installer
renders itself and applies with kubectl, never anything Docker builds; the only thing a
Docker daemon adds is a best-effort `docker login` in the pre-install validators, which
reports `skipped` without it. That is also what lets the installer run from inside a pod,
where there is no daemon at all.

The secret is piped to `kubectl apply` on standard input rather than passed as
`kubectl create secret docker-registry --docker-password …`, so your registry password is
never a command-line argument: not in the process table, and not in the command text the
installer prints if a kubectl call fails. Worth knowing if you run this in CI, where that
output is usually captured and kept.

## Quick Start

### Run directly (no download)

Pin to a release tag. Pick one from [the releases page](https://github.com/mlrun/ce/releases)
— the installer from tag `mlrun-ce-X` is the one tested against chart `X`:

```bash
CE_TAG=mlrun-ce-0.12.0-rc.15
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/mlrun/ce@${CE_TAG}#subdirectory=scripts" \
  mlrun-ce-installer install
```

`uvx` fetches the installer, resolves its dependencies into a throwaway environment and
runs it, leaving nothing behind on your system Python.

Substituting `development` for the tag always gets the newest installer, but it moves with
every merge, so two runs a day apart can differ. Prefer a tag anywhere reproducibility
matters, CI especially.

A tag pins the installer, not its dependencies down to the patch: this path resolves typer,
click, rich and pyyaml fresh, within the ranges `scripts/pyproject.toml` declares. The clone
path below is the exactly-pinned one, via the committed `scripts/install.py.lock`. If you
need that guarantee without a clone, install into an environment you control and lock it
there.

### Install as a named command

```bash
CE_TAG=mlrun-ce-0.12.0-rc.15
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/mlrun/ce@${CE_TAG}#subdirectory=scripts"
mlrun-ce-installer version
```

`uv tool upgrade mlrun-ce-installer` moves it forward; `uv tool uninstall
mlrun-ce-installer` removes it.

### From a clone of this repo

```bash
./scripts/install.py
```

Still installs the published chart. Add `--chart-path ./charts/mlrun-ce` to install the
chart from your working tree instead.

The `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` shebang means `./scripts/install.py` is enough —
you do not need to say `uv run`. Running it as `python3 scripts/install.py` also works: if
the dependencies are missing it re-executes itself under uv rather than failing on an
import.

To get the `mlrun-ce-installer` command while working on a clone, symlink it onto your
PATH:

```bash
make installer-link                                    # links into ~/.local/bin
make installer-link INSTALLER_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin   # or somewhere else on PATH
```

The link points back at your working tree, so edits take effect immediately and
`mlrun-ce-installer version` reports the chart version rather than `unknown`. `make
installer-unlink` removes it.

---

## Commands

```bash
mlrun-ce-installer install [options]     # the default when no command is given
mlrun-ce-installer uninstall [--hard-clean]
mlrun-ce-installer version
mlrun-ce-installer help
```

The command is optional. Flags on their own mean `install`, so `--dry-run` and
`install --dry-run` are the same thing and anything written before commands existed still
works. `uninstall` is equivalent to the older `--uninstall` flag. A word that isn't one of
the four is rejected rather than treated as an install, so a typo like `unistall` can't
deploy a cluster by accident.

Colored output is suppressed automatically when stdout isn't a terminal, and when
`NO_COLOR` is set, so piped and redirected runs stay readable.

---

## Versioning and releases

The installer has no version of its own. It ships with the chart and is released by the
same tag, so `mlrun-ce-installer version` reports the version from
`charts/mlrun-ce/Chart.yaml` — bumping the chart bumps the installer, with no second copy
to keep in step.

That works however you run it. From a clone the version is read from the chart directly,
and symlinks are resolved first, so `make installer-link` still finds the chart in the
checkout it points at. Installed via `uvx` or `uv tool install` there is no chart on disk,
so the version is baked into the package when it is built from the tag. Only a copy that
is neither — the file moved to a bin directory by hand, say — reports `unknown`, because
nothing then records where it came from; that's what pinning to a release tag answers.

They're coupled on purpose. The installer encodes chart internals — the chart's fixed
NodePorts, and the `--set` value paths it writes — so an installer and a chart from the
same tag are the only pairing guaranteed to agree. Independent versions would invite a
mismatch whose failure mode is silent: a renamed value path becomes a `--set` that
quietly does nothing.

Releasing follows from that. A push to `development` or a `X.Y.x` branch runs
chart-releaser, which tags `mlrun-ce-<chart version>` and cuts a GitHub Release; that
tag's tree contains `scripts/`, which is what the pinned `uvx --from "git+…@<tag>"`
invocations above resolve against. So shipping an installer change is just merging it with a
chart version bump — there's no separate installer release to cut. Note the chart
tarball published to the Helm repo packages `charts/mlrun-ce` only, so the installer is
available from the git tag rather than from inside the `.tgz`.

## Installation flows

### Interactive install

Run the script with no flags. You will be prompted for:

1. Docker registry username, password, server URL, and email
2. External host address (auto-detected — see [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for the fallback chain)
3. Docker registry URL for images

```bash
./scripts/install.py
```

### Non-interactive / CI install

Set `CI=true` (or pass `--non-interactive`) and export the required values. The script will never prompt — any required value that is missing causes an immediate exit 1 instead of hanging on stdin.

```bash
export CI=true
export REGISTRY_USERNAME=myuser
export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=mypassword
export REGISTRY_SERVER=https://index.docker.io/v1/
export REGISTRY_EMAIL=me@example.com
export REGISTRY_URL=index.docker.io/myuser
export EXTERNAL_HOST_ADDRESS=localhost   # or minikube ip

./scripts/install.py
```

### Install this repo's chart

The installer ships alongside the chart it installs, but does **not** install it by
default — pass `--chart-path ./charts/mlrun-ce` to install the chart from your working
tree instead of the published release. This is how you test a branch or PR: check it out
here, then point the installer at the chart directory. No git operations happen inside
the installer.

Chart dependencies are resolved first. `install.py` prefers `helm dependency build`, which
honours `requirements.lock` rather than re-resolving `requirements.yaml`, and skips the
fetch entirely when `charts/` already holds every tarball the lock names — so a second run,
or a run on an air-gapped host, does not need the upstream Helm repos. Pass
`--skip-dependency-update` to suppress the fetch unconditionally.

```bash
# 1. Check out the branch/PR you want to test
git checkout my-branch

# 2. Dry-run first to validate without deploying
./scripts/install.py --chart-path ./charts/mlrun-ce --dry-run

# 3. Install for real
./scripts/install.py --chart-path ./charts/mlrun-ce
```

`--ce-version` is ignored in local-path mode — the chart version comes from
`charts/mlrun-ce/Chart.yaml` as it exists on your branch. Drop `--chart-path` (and
optionally add `--ce-version`) to go back to installing a published release.

### Dry run

Renders the Helm chart and validates it against the cluster API server without creating any resources. Useful to confirm a configuration is valid before a real install.

```bash
./scripts/install.py --dry-run
```

Pre-install validators still run in `--dry-run` — see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md#pre-install-validators).

### Uninstall

```bash
./scripts/install.py --uninstall
```

This runs `helm uninstall` with a timeout controlled by `HELM_TIMEOUT` (default `960s`). The namespace and CRDs are **not** deleted. For deleting persistent data too, see the [FAQ](docs/faq.md#deleting-everything-including-the-namespace).

## After Installation

Once complete, the script prints an access table with URLs and credentials for each service:

```
==============================================
  MLRun CE - Access URLs
==============================================
SERVICE            | URL                      | CREDENTIALS
-------------------+--------------------------+------------------
MLRun UI           | http://localhost:80      |
Grafana            | http://localhost:3000     | admin / prom-operator
...
==============================================
