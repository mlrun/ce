# Interactive installer for MLRun CE on local Kubernetes. Creates a Docker registry secret
# from your credentials, then installs the chart with your local URL and registry URL.
#
# This file is only the entry point; the implementation lives in the ce_installer package
# beside it. See ce_installer/__init__.py for the module layout.
#
# From a clone of this repo (installs the published chart):
#   ./scripts/install.py
#
# From a clone, installing this repo's own chart on the current branch:
#   ./scripts/install.py --chart-path ./charts/mlrun-ce
#
# Without a clone — pin a release tag, see https://github.com/mlrun/ce/releases;
# "development" also works but moves with every merge:
#   uvx --from "git+https://github.com/mlrun/ce@mlrun-ce-0.12.0-rc.15#subdirectory=scripts" \
#     mlrun-ce-installer install
#
# Commands: install (the default), uninstall, version, help. Flags may be passed with no
# command at all, so every invocation above still means the same thing without one.
#
# Non-interactive (CI): set REGISTRY_* and EXTERNAL_HOST_ADDRESS, REGISTRY_URL; see -h.
# Requirements: uv, helm, kubectl (configured with a cluster). docker is optional — it is
# only used for the best-effort registry-auth validator.
