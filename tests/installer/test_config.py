"""ce-config.yaml handling: `load_config` and the required-field check behind it.

Ported from the `--config` / load_config group of tests/install_tests.bats, which is
retired with install.sh. The bash cases asserted on exit codes and echoed shell variables;
here the equivalent is an InstallerError carrying a `.code` and the fields it left on
Settings.

The whole point of this module is precedence — flag > env > file > built-in default — and
precedence is the kind of rule that regresses silently: a config file that quietly wins
over `--chart-path` still installs something, just not what was asked for. Most of the
tests below therefore pin the *negative*: what the file must NOT change.

One bash case is deliberately not ported. `load_config exits 1 when yq is not installed`
(install_tests.bats:548) described a prerequisite the port does not have — YAML is parsed
with pyyaml, so there is no yq to be missing and no exit to assert.
