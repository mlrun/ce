"""End-to-end argv expectations: what the installer asks the cluster to do, for real runs.

This replaces the differential harness. That harness ran install.sh and install.py side by
side and compared the calls they made; once the bash script is gone there is no second
implementation to compare against, so the calls are recorded here instead. The expectations
in golden/ were generated while both still existed and were confirmed identical to the bash
output, so they carry the same authority the oracle did.

The unit suites patch the helm/kubectl wrappers and check one function. This runs the whole
program as a subprocess against stub binaries, so it catches what those cannot: a flag that
parses correctly but never reaches helm, a step that runs in the wrong order, an argument
dropped between layers.

Regenerate after an intentional change:

    make installer-test-golden-update

and read the diff as the reviewable part of your PR — every changed line is a change in what
the installer does to somebody's cluster.
