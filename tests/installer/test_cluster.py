"""Chart-source selection, namespace creation, and the KUBE_CONTEXT-aware wrappers.

Ports install_tests.bats 435, 444, 456, 471, 483 and 1239. Everything here decides *which*
cluster and *which* chart an install lands on, so a wrong answer is not a cosmetic one: a
swapped context flag installs into the wrong cluster, and a chart-source mistake installs
a different chart than the operator asked for.

The dependency-resolution tests have no bats counterpart — `--chart-path` preferring
`helm dependency build`, skipping the fetch when `charts/` already satisfies the lock, and
obeying `--skip-dependency-update` are deliberate divergences from install.sh (which always
ran `helm dependency update`), recorded in scripts/AGENTS.md.
